# CryptoBuddy
Testing environment allowing you to test different crypto trading strategies before going live


## Getting Started
All of the classes are written to let you emulate trades buying and selling currency virtually. Run the CT.py and check the code. A lot could be improved. I will update the source in the near future. This is just for other devs who wants to implement their trading algorithms virtually and checking up on the results.
